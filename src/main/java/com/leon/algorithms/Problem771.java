 * You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels,
 * and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.
 * You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 *
 * The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters.
 * Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
     * Output: 3
 *
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
     * Output: 0
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1. S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
 * 2. The characters in J are distinct.
